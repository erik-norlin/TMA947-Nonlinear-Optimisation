We can see that to maximize the dual the term epsilon*y_n+1 has to be minimized since the term is positive (epsilon >= 0 and y_n+1 >= 0) 
and that the minus will turn it negative.
The minimum of this term is 0, so we have two cases

y_n+1=0:
Since y_n+1 is only multiplied with every element of the last row of Â (the row corresponding to the bounded sum), 
this row will be omitted in the maximization of the dual.
This would result in the same dual maximum as if the bounded sum never existed in the primal.

epsilon=0:
If epsilon is 0 then the bounded sum is 0 and there is no violation of the constraint in the primal.

If both are zero

Thus, the maximized dual either corresponds to the that the minimum of the primal 
is the same as the minimum of the primal without the bounded sum,
or that there is no violation of the constraints in the primal (epsilon=0).




We can see that to maximize the dual the term epsilon*y_n+1 has to be minimized since the term is positive 
(epsilon >= 0 and y_n+1 >= 0) and that the minus will turn it negative. 
The minimum of this term is 0, so either epsilon or y_n+1 is 0.

y_n+1=0:
Since y_n+1 is multiplied with every element of the last row of Â (the row corresponding to the bounded sum), 
this row will be omitted in the maximization of the dual.
We also have that y_i=0 for all i. 
This means that the max dual is 0.

epsilon=0:
This means that all v are 0 so the last row of Â is 0 in this case as well.
The difference here is that all y must not be 0.
This means that the max dual can potentially be larger or smaller than if epsilon > 0.
